# Tools to Explore Price Transparency Data
This repository is part of a personal project. 
I'm exploring the <a href="https://transparency-in-coverage.uhc.com/">price transparency data</a> posted by large insurance companies. 

Insurance companies must post transparency data on their websites, but they don't make it easy to access and retrieve the data in an aggregate form. 


**collectRawDataURLs.py** is a script to retrieve the URLs where the data lives. This tool will fetch thousands of URLs to .json.gz files

**parseRecords.py** is a tool to unzip and parse the large files themselves 

Each file is built around a schema recommended, but not required, by CMS. Here's a diagram of part of it, generated by JSON Crack.
